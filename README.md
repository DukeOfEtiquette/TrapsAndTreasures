## Description

This is a simple iOS application written with Swift 3 to demonstrate what it means to have a cloud application. The premise of the game is simple: Move your character around the map looking for treasures, planting traps for other players, and avoiding traps. However, your movement points are only replenished when you actually move about the real world.
